## Next Steps

### For Development Team
1. **No outstanding proposals** - openspec/changes/ is empty
2. **Test suite maintenance** - Fix remaining 14 test failures (low priority)
3. **Workshop preparation** - System is functionally ready
4. **New features** - Create new proposals in openspec/changes/

### For Autonomous Agent
- Monitor for new proposals in openspec/changes/
- Continue test suite health monitoring
- Support workshop preparation as needed

This isn't an app. It's infrastructure for the next economy.

**We've built it accordingly. ✊**
