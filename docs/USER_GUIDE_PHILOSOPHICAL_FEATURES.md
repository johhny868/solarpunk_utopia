## 1. Conscientization Prompts (Paulo Freire)

> "The oppressed must not, in seeking to regain their humanity, become in turn oppressors"

### What is it?

Occasional reflective prompts that ask you **WHY** you're participating, not just what you're doing.

### When do I see these?

- **First offer**: "Why are you offering this?"
- **Receiving a gift**: "What does it mean to receive without paying?"
- **After an exchange**: "How was this different from buying/selling?"
- **Weekly reflection**: "This week you gave X and received Y. What do you notice?"
- **Milestones**: "Your commune has shared 100 gifts. What's happening here?"

### Do I have to answer?

**No!** There's always a prominent "Skip" button. These prompts are invitations, not homework.

### What happens to my reflections?

- Your **personal reflections** are private (only you see them)
- You can **choose to share** anonymously in the Community Dialogue Space
- Shared reflections help the community learn together

### Examples

**Prompt**: "Why are you offering this?"

**Options**:
- ☐ I have abundance and want to share
- ☐ I want to build connections
- ☐ I'm experimenting with non-market exchange
- ☐ Other: ___________

**Follow-up**: "What does it feel like to offer something without expecting payment?"

### Community Dialogue Space

Not a forum—a **problem-posing space** where the community explores contradictions together.

**Example Dialogue**:

**Problem**: "Some people offer a lot, others rarely. Why?"

**Voices** (anonymous):
- "Maybe they have more free time?"
- "Or more privilege/resources to start with"
- "I feel guilty when I can't contribute equally"

**Purpose**: Surface tensions, don't hide them. Growth happens through honest reflection, not forced consensus.

## 2. Anonymous Gifts (Emma Goldman)

> "Ask for work. If they don't give you work, ask for bread. If they do not give you work or bread, then take bread."

### What is it?

The ability to give **without attribution**, credit, or surveillance. Pure solidarity.

### How do I use it?

#### Offering Anonymously

1. Create a listing (offer or need)
2. Toggle "Make this anonymous" ☑
3. Post

**Result**: Your name doesn't appear. The gift goes to the **Community Shelf**.

#### Browsing the Community Shelf

1. Navigate to "Community Shelf"
2. See all anonymous gifts available
3. Take what you need—no questions asked

### Why would I want this?

- **Freedom from reciprocity anxiety**: Give without expecting anything back, even gratitude
- **No social credit scores**: Your generosity isn't tracked or gamified
- **Pure mutual aid**: Like leaving vegetables at a Little Free Library—just because

### What if someone takes too much?

The system trusts the community. If scarcity becomes an issue, address it as a community discussion, not through surveillance.

### Can I see who gave what?

**No.** Anonymous means anonymous. Even admins can't see who posted anonymous gifts (unless required by law).

## 3. Rest Mode (Emma Goldman + Peter Kropotkin)

> "The right to be lazy" + "From each according to ability, to each according to need"

### What is it?

A way to **take breaks without guilt**. The system actively protects your right to rest.

### How do I use it?

#### Setting Rest Mode

1. Go to your profile
2. Click "Status" → Select:
   - **Resting** (short break)
   - **Sabbatical** (extended rest)
3. Optionally add a note: "Recovering from burnout", "Family time", "Just need space"

#### What happens when I'm resting?

- ✅ Your status badge shows "Resting 😴"
- ✅ **No notifications** sent to you (the system respects your rest)
- ✅ You can still browse, but offers/needs don't ping you
- ✅ No pressure, no guilt-trips

#### When to return?

**Whenever you're ready.** Change status back to "Active" when you want to engage again.

### What if I feel guilty?

**Don't.** This system is built on:

- **Goldman's "Right to Be Lazy"**: Productivity culture is oppressive. Rest is resistance.
- **Kropotkin's "From each according to ability"**: Your ability changes. The commune supports you regardless.

If you receive notifications while resting, **report it**—that's a Goldman Test violation.

### Will people judge me?

The system doesn't show:
- How long you've been resting
- How often you rest
- Comparisons with others

Your status badge just says "Resting 😴"—neutral and matter-of-fact.

## 4. Power Dynamics Dashboard (Mikhail Bakunin)

> "Where there is authority, there is no freedom."

### What is it?

A dashboard that **makes invisible power visible** by detecting emergent hierarchies:

- **Battery Warlords**: Resource concentration (e.g., one person controls 80% of solar charging)
- **Skill Gatekeepers**: Knowledge monopolies (e.g., only Alice can repair bikes)
- **Coordination Monopolies**: Bottleneck coordinators (e.g., Carol coordinates everything)

### Why do we need this?

**Bakunin's insight**: Authority doesn't just come from titles—it emerges from:
- Control over critical resources
- Monopoly on essential skills
- Becoming the "go-to" coordinator

Even well-meaning people can become **de facto authorities** without realizing it.

### How do I check for power concentrations?

1. Navigate to **"Power Dynamics"** in the menu
2. See current alerts organized by type:
   - ⚠️ **Critical** (>70% concentration)
   - ⚠️ **High** (50-70%)
   - ⚠️ **Medium** (30-50%)

### Example Alert

**Type**: Resource Concentration (Battery Warlord)

**Agent**: Dave

**Resource**: Battery Charging

**Concentration**: 80%

**Dependency Count**: 15 people

**Analysis**:
> Dave provides 80% of Battery Charging in the community. This creates dependency for 15 people.
>
> **Why this matters**: Only power source. If Dave leaves or gets sick, 15 people lose access to electricity.
>
> **Bakunin's warning**: Even benevolent control is still control. This concentration creates unintentional authority and fragility.

**Suggestions**:
- ⚠️ **URGENT**: Discuss this concentration at next community meeting
- Organize a workshop on Battery Charging maintenance
- Pool resources to acquire more chargers
- Consider distributed solar/battery system
- Discuss as community: Is this concentration acceptable?

### Is this blaming Dave?

**NO!** The alert celebrates Dave's contribution:

> "Dave is doing amazing work! ✓
>
> BUT: Creates dependency ⚠"

This is a **structural issue**, not a personal failing. Dave probably didn't realize the dependency.

### What should we do?

1. **Acknowledge**: "Wow, we're really dependent on Dave for power"
2. **Discuss**: "Is this okay? What if Dave leaves or gets sick?"
3. **Decentralize** (if needed):
   - Ask Dave to teach battery workshops
   - Pool resources for more chargers
   - Document Dave's knowledge
4. **Celebrate mentorship**: Dave's willingness to share skills is valuable

### Decentralization Score

See your community's overall score (0-100):
- **90-100**: Excellent (highly decentralized)
- **70-89**: Good (some concentrations to address)
- **50-69**: Fair (active decentralization needed)
- **<50**: Needs Improvement (urgent action recommended)

## Philosophy in Practice: A Day in the Life

**Morning**: Alice wakes up and checks the Community Shelf. Someone left anonymous tomatoes! She takes what she needs—no questions asked. (GAP-61: Anonymous Gifts)

**Midday**: Alice gets a prompt: "What does it mean to receive without paying?" She reflects: "It feels abundant. Like the world isn't scarce." She shares this anonymously in the Dialogue Space. (GAP-59: Conscientization)

**Afternoon**: The Power Dynamics Dashboard shows an alert: "Alice is the only bike mechanic (100% concentration). 20 people depend on this skill." Alice sees the suggestions: "Teach a bike repair workshop", "Document your process". She decides to host a workshop next week. (GAP-64: Power Dynamics)

**Evening**: Alice feels exhausted from coordinating so much. She sets her status to "Resting 😴" with a note: "Need a break, will be back soon." The notifications stop. The community respects her rest. (GAP-62: Rest Mode)

**Result**: A community that:
- Reflects critically on its practices (Freire)
- Gives without surveillance (Goldman)
- Respects rest without guilt (Goldman + Kropotkin)
- Resists hierarchy formation (Bakunin)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Are these features mandatory?

**A**: No! All philosophical features are:
- **Optional** (you can skip prompts, ignore alerts)
- **Non-coercive** (no penalties for not participating)
- **Community-decided** (your commune can disable features if consensus agrees)

### Q: What if someone abuses anonymous gifts?

**A**: Trust the community first. If scarcity becomes real (not just feared), address it through community dialogue, not surveillance.

### Q: I don't want to see power dynamics alerts

**A**: You can hide the dashboard. But consider: making power visible helps the community resist hierarchy. Even if you don't look, others benefit from transparency.

### Q: The rest mode badge feels judgmental

**A**: If it does, that's a design failure—please report it! The badge should be neutral. We enforce the Goldman Test: no guilt, no engagement metrics, no productivity pressure.

### Q: What's the "Goldman Test"?

**A**: Before any notification/feature, we ask:
1. Is this coercive? (FORBIDDEN)
2. Does this guilt-trip resting users? (FORBIDDEN)
3. Does this track/gamify contributions? (FORBIDDEN)
4. Does this respect autonomy? (REQUIRED)

If it fails the Goldman Test, it doesn't ship.
