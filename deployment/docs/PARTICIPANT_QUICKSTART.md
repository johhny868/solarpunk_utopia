# Your Solarpunk Phone - Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Solarpunk gift economy mesh network!

## What's on Your Phone?

Your phone has been provisioned with everything you need to participate in the gift economy:

### Core Apps
- **Solarpunk** - Create offers, post needs, browse matches
- **Briar** - Secure messaging and forums
- **Manyverse** - Social feed (Scuttlebutt)
- **Syncthing** - File sharing
- **Kiwix** - Offline knowledge (permaculture, repair guides)
- **Organic Maps** - Offline navigation
- **Termux** - Terminal (for advanced users)

## Getting Started (2 minutes)

### 1. Create Your First Offer

1. Open the **Solarpunk** app
2. Tap "Create Offer"
3. Choose category (Food, Tools, Skills, etc.)
4. Enter quantity and description
5. Set availability window
6. Tap "Publish"

**That's it!** Your offer is now on the mesh and will sync to other phones.

### 2. Post a Need

1. Tap "Create Need"
2. Choose what you're looking for
3. Describe what you need and when
4. Tap "Publish"

The matchmaker agent will look for compatible offers and suggest matches.

### 3. Browse and Match

1. Tap "Browse" to see offers from others
2. Filter by category, location, or time
3. Tap an offer to see details
4. Tap "Request Match" if it meets your need
5. Wait for the provider to approve
6. Arrange handoff when both approve

### 4. Complete an Exchange

When you meet to exchange:

1. Both parties open the exchange
2. Confirm the exchange happened
3. Rate the experience (optional)

This builds trust in the network and helps improve matching.

## How the Mesh Works

### No Internet Required
- Your phone connects to other phones via WiFi Direct or local Access Points
- Messages and offers spread from phone to phone
- Works during internet outages or in rural areas
- The mesh IS the network

### Bridge Nodes
- Some phones act as "bridges" between locations
- They carry bundles when people walk between areas (garden → kitchen → workshop)
- You might become a bridge by just moving around!

### Local Cells
- Join or form local cells (groups of 5-50 people)
- Coordinate within your neighborhood or affinity group
- Cells can federate for larger coordination

## Battery Tips

Your phone's role affects battery usage:

- **Citizen** (most phones): Balanced mode, syncs every 10 min
- **Bridge**: More frequent syncing, uses more battery
- **AP**: Hotspot always on (keep plugged in)
- **Library**: Large storage, keep plugged in

**General tips:**
- Keep WiFi enabled (mesh needs it)
- Disable mobile data to save battery
- Close unused apps
- Charge when battery drops below 20%

## Privacy & Security

### Your Data
- All data lives on YOUR phone (no servers)
- You control what you share
- Offers and needs sync via the mesh
- Private messages stay encrypted

### Web of Trust
- Trust scores based on vouches from others
- High-trust features require community vouching
- Helps keep infiltrators out

### Panic Mode (if enabled)
- Duress PIN: Logs you into decoy account
- Quick wipe: Hold power + volume down for 5s
- Use responsibly - this is for emergencies

## Need Help?

### At the Workshop
- Ask any facilitator (look for green badges)
- Join the #help channel in Briar
- Check the troubleshooting poster

### After the Workshop
- Post questions in the Briar forum
- Ask your local cell steward
- Check the offline Kiwix docs (search "Solarpunk Help")

## What's Next?

### First Hour

- ✓ Post at least one need
- ✓ Browse what others are sharing
- ✓ Connect with 3-5 people nearby

### First Day

### First Week

## Remember

> Every transaction in the gift economy is a transaction that DIDN'T go to Bezos.
> Every person connected to the mesh is someone who can't be isolated.
> Every cell that forms is a community that can protect its own.

Welcome to the new economy. We're building it together.
